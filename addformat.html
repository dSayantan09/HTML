The Solar System was formed approximately five billion years ago by a nebula cloud. When this cloud began a process of rotating, 
it began to compact due to a force known as accretion, a force caused by matter compacting together and forming layers that create pressure 
and create a solid or gaseous-like material depending on the amount of gravity reacting on the object from a nearby gravitational emitting source. 
After this process, the gas created the Sun, using up 99.86% of all of the Solar System's matter and mass. The rest of the cloud was used to form the inner and outer planets.
There are two main regions in the Solar System: the inner planets and the outer planets. These regions are seperated by a region known as the Asteroid belt.
