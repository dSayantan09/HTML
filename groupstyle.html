        Of the inner planets, Mercury is the closest to our Sun and the smallest of the terrestrial planets. This
        small planet looks very much like the Earth's Moon and is even a similar grayish color, and it even has many
        deep craters and is covered by a thin layer of tiny particle silicates'.
        Its magnetic field is only about 1 percent that of Earth's, and it's very thin atmosphere means that it is
        hot during the day (up to 430°C) and freezing at night (as low as -187 °C) because the atmosphere can
        neither keep heat in or out. It has no moons of its own and is comprised mostly of iron and nickel. Mercury
        is one of the densest planets in the Solar System.

        Venus, which is about the same size as Earth, has a thick toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the
        hottest planet in the Solar System. This atmosphere is composed of 96% carbon dioxide, along with nitrogen
        and a few other gases. Dense clouds within Venus' atmosphere are composed of sulphuric acid and other
        corrosive compounds, with very litter water.
        Only two spacecraft have ever penetrated Venus's thick atmosphere, but it's not just man-made objects that
        have trouble getting through. There are fewer crater impacts on Venus than other planets because all but the
        largest meteors don't make it through the thick air without disintegrating. Much of Venus' surface is marked
        with volcanoes and deep canyons — the biggest of which is over 6400 km (4,000 mi) long.
        Venus is often called the “morning star” because, with the exception of Earth's moon, it's the brightest
        object we see in the sky. Like Mercury, Venus has no moon of its own.

        Earth is the third inner planet and the one we know best. Of the four terrestrial planets, 
        Earth is the largest, and the only one that currently has liquid water, which is necessary for life as we know it. 
        Earth's atmosphere protects the planet from dangerous radiation and helps keep valuable sunlight and warmth in, which is also essential for life to survive.
        Like the other terrestrial planets, Earth has a rocky surface with mountains and canyons, and a heavy metal core. 
        Earth's atmosphere contains water vapor, which helps to moderate daily temperatures. Like Mercury, the Earth has an internal magnetic field.
        And our Moon, the only one we have, is comprised of a mixture of various rocks and minerals.

        Mars is the fourth and final inner planet, and also known as the “Red Planet” due to the rust of iron-rich materials that form the planet's surface. 
        Mars also has some of the most interesting terrain features of any of the terrestrial planets. 
        These include the largest mountain in the Solar System - Olympus Mons - which rises some 21,229 m (69,649 ft) above the surface, and a giant canyon called Valles Marineris.             Valles Marineris is 4000 km (2500 mi) long and reaches depths of up to 7 km (4 mi)!
        For comparison, the Grand Canyon in Arizona is about 800 km (500 mi) long and 1.6 km (1 mi) deep. 
        In fact, the extent of Valles Marineris is as long as the United States and it spans about 20 percent (1/5) of the entire distance around Mars. 
        Much of the surface is very old and filled with craters, but there are geologically newer areas of the planet as well.
